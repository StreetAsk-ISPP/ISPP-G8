# User Stories and Use Cases
This document presents the user stories and real-world use cases identified for the application.  
Additionally, it describes the prioritization methodology applied to these requirements, based on an adapted MoSCoW framework for defining the scope of the minimum viable product (MVP).

## Prioritization Methodology
The stories are organized into three priority levels based on the MoSCoW framework adapted for MVP:

1. **P0 (Must Have)**: Critical functionality without which the MVP is not viable  
2. **P1 (Should Have)**: Important functionality that adds significant value to the MVP  
3. **P2 (Could Have)**: Desirable functionality for post-MVP versions
