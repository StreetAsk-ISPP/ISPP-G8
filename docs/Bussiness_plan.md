# Business Plan & Monetization Model 
## 1. Executive Summary 
The event industries currently depend on traditional review platforms that don’t reflect real-time experiences. Services like Google Maps and TripAdvisor rely on reviews that can be outdated. This leads to poor decisions for users and a lack of useful insights for venues and organizers. Our project introduces a real-time review system, where users can only share opinions if they are physically present at a venue or event. This ensures genuine information about what’s happening right now. Users can quickly evaluate key aspects like atmosphere, crowd size, music, wait times, and overall experience. Reviews are easy to submit, quick, and expire shortly after posting, emphasizing live, moment-based feedback. For users, the app enables quicker and better leisure choices, reducing wasted time and disappointing experiences. For venues and event organizers, it offers live feedback, greater visibility among potential customers nearby, and valuable insights into customer experiences. The initial market strategy focuses on launching in one city and a specific area (nightlife and events) to quickly gain traction and validate the model before expanding to new cities and other categories such as restaurants and cultural events. With a strong value proposition focused on presence verification, immediacy, and temporary content, we address a clear gap in the leisure and hospitality market. 

## Company Overview 
### 2.1 Vision and Mission 
#### Vision 
To make it easy for people to know what a place or event is really like right now. 
#### Mission 
To provide real-time, location-verified opinions from people inside venues and events. This helps users make better decisions and gives venues immediate feedback. 
### 2.2 Problem Statement 
People depend on review platforms to decide where to go. However, most available reviews are outdated, generic, and not connected to the current reality of a venue or event. A place with good historical ratings might offer a poor experience due to crowd size, atmosphere, music, or service, leading to frustration and bad choices. At the same time, venues and event organizers lack access to real-time feedback. Existing tools only provide delayed or aggregated reviews, making it hard to understand what’s happening on-site and to respond quickly to improve the experience. As a result, users make decisions based on incomplete information, and venues miss opportunities to adjust and enhance the live experience. 
### 2.3 Proposed Solution 
Our platform changes the leisure decision-making process by replacing static, historical archives with a real-time verification system. By using GPS-fencing, we ensure feedback comes only from users physically present at a venue. This "Proof of Presence" model eliminates fake and outdated reviews, providing a clear and authentic view of the current state of any event or establishment. The main experience focuses on temporary, lightweight updates that reflect the immediate vibe of a location. Users can quickly evaluate crowd density, music styles, and wait times through a dynamic feed that expires shortly after being posted. This keeps the information fresh and relevant, allowing people to navigate the city with confidence and avoid disappointing experiences. For venues and organizers, the solution acts as a live operational dashboard and a responsive marketing tool. It allows them to get instant feedback and adjust their operations on the fly, while also driving foot traffic through real-time promotions. By connecting venues and nearby customers, we turn live data into a powerful tool for both customer satisfaction and business improvement. To address specific, on-demand information needs, the platform also includes a Q&A feature. Users can post questions to a location, which are instantly routed to people currently on-site, allowing them to get answers for hyper-specific queries that general ratings might not cover.

## Product 
### 3.1 App Description 
The app is a real-time social intelligence platform that acts as a live pulse of the city. It provides both a map-based and feed-based interface, allowing users to see exactly what is happening inside any venue at that moment. By combining GPS-verified check-ins with temporary multimedia and quick-rating tags, the app removes the guesswork of going out. 
### 3.2 Key Features 
The main features include a Live Heatmap showing real-time activity levels, Presence-Gated Reviews that unlock only when the user is on-site, and Ephemeral Status Updates that disappear after four hours to keep data fresh. Additionally, it has Smart Filters (music type, crowd age, wait times) and a Venue Portal for business owners to send instant "Flash Deals" to nearby users. 

### 3.3 Value Proposition 
Our value comes from absolute relevance. For users, we provide confidence in having a good time with a look-before-you-go feature. For venues, we offer a direct way to turn digital browsers into physical foot traffic through real-time visibility and instant feedback loops that were previously hard to capture. 
### 3.4 Competitive Differentiation 
Unlike Instagram, which is focused on curated aesthetics, or Google Maps, which is historical and static, our platform is practical and immediate. We stand out with our Proof of Presence technology. While other platforms struggle with review manipulation or fake ratings, our data comes exclusively from people currently experiencing the event. 

### 3.5 Live Q&A: 
A feature allowing users to ask questions directly to a venue's location, which are answered in real-time by people physically present there.
 
## Competitive Analysis 
### 4.1 Target Market 
The project mainly targets the urban leisure and hospitality sector, starting with the high-frequency nightlife and live events industry. This market has a strong demand for immediacy and a demographic that relies heavily on social validation for their choices. By launching in major metropolitan areas, we tap into thousands of venues, including nightclubs, bars, festivals, and pop-up events, that strive to stand out in a crowded digital space. This initial focus serves as a strategic entry point to validate our real-time verification technology before branching out into wider categories like restaurants, cultural shows, and hospitality services. 
### 4.2 Direct and Indirect Competitors 
Direct competitors include localized nightlife apps (such as Nightlife +) and discovery platforms like Resident Advisor or Dice, but they lack live social feedback. Indirect competitors encompass social media giants (Instagram, TikTok) and established review sites (Google Maps, TripAdvisor, Yelp). ### 4.3 Competitive Advantages Our main advantage is the Hyper-Short Feedback Loop. By making reviews expire, we own the "now" niche. Additionally, our Verification Layer (GPS-fencing) builds a high-trust community that established platforms cannot replicate without changing their core structure. This creates a significant barrier to entry for competitors who rely on permanent data.

## Business Model & Monetization

### 6.1 Business Model

The application is built around a **real-time, location-based question and answer platform**, where the core value lies in the **credibility and immediacy of the information**. Credibility is ensured by restricting responses to users who are physically present within the geographical area defined by each question.

Initially, the product follows a **B2C-first, free-access model**, focused on maximizing adoption, participation, and the generation of high-quality, location-verified content. Any user can ask questions tied to a specific point or area on the map, and only users currently within that area can respond in real time. Each question creates a temporary discussion thread that expires automatically.

The business model is designed to evolve towards a **freemium and B2B hybrid**, where monetization is layered on top of a validated core product. Businesses and organizers can later use the platform as a contextual communication and visibility channel, but these features are intentionally secondary and not part of the initial MVP.

This staged approach allows the project to first validate the technical and functional value of the geolocated Q&A system before introducing monetization, reducing product and market risk.

---

### 6.2 Revenue Streams

Revenue generation is planned to be incremental and strictly tied to **visibility, reach, or prioritization**, without restricting access to the core functionality.

1. **Paid Highlighted Questions (B2C)**  
   Users may pay to enhance a question by:
   - Reaching a larger number of users within the selected area.
   - Increasing notification priority.
   - Extending the visibility duration of the question.

   This model is based on microtransactions driven by specific, time-sensitive information needs.

2. **Highlighted Events and Posts for Businesses (B2B)**  
   Companies and organizers can pay to:
   - Promote events or activities on the map.
   - Increase visibility for specific locations or time windows.
   - Communicate contextual information to nearby users.

3. **Usage-Based Limitations**  
   Limits may be applied to:
   - Number of active questions.
   - Number of events created.
   - Maximum geographic reach.

   Paid options allow users or businesses to bypass these limits when needed.

4. **Future Revenue Extensions**  
   In later phases, additional revenue streams may include:
   - Premium subscriptions.
   - Access to aggregated, anonymized insights for businesses.
   - Reputation-based advantages tied to user contribution quality.

---

### 6.3 Pricing Strategy

The pricing strategy is guided by three core principles: **low entry barrier**, **flexibility**, and **clear value alignment**.

- **End Users (B2C):**
  - Free access to the core question-and-answer functionality.
  - Optional pay-per-use enhancements for visibility or reach.
  - No mandatory subscriptions during early phases.

- **Businesses and Organizers (B2B):**
  - Pay-per-event or pay-per-highlight model.
  - Future tiered plans based on usage volume and visibility needs.
  - Pricing adapted to the temporary and local nature of events.

This strategy minimizes friction for new users while enabling monetization only when a clear and immediate benefit is perceived.

---

### 6.4 Monetization Phases

Monetization is introduced progressively, in line with product maturity and validated user behavior.

**Phase 1 – MVP (No Monetization)**  
- Core functionality only: geolocated questions and real-time answers.
- Focus on validating usability, engagement, and response quality.
- Collection of key metrics such as response time, answer rate, and geographic density.

**Phase 2 – Initial Monetization**  
- Introduction of paid highlighted questions.
- Paid event visibility for businesses and organizers.
- Soft limits based on account type.

**Phase 3 – Advanced Monetization and Scaling**  
- Optional premium plans for power users.
- Advanced tools and analytics for businesses.
- Geographic expansion and new use cases.

This phased approach ensures monetization does not compromise early adoption and is always grounded in validated user value.

## Roadmap
### 9.1 MVP
#### 9.1.1 MVP Use Cases

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is defined with the goal of validating the core value of the application: allowing users to post questions linked to a specific location and receive real-time answers from people who are physically present in that area.

The MVP deliberately excludes any functionality related to monetization, business profiles, subscriptions, advanced events, or social features, in order to reduce complexity and encourage early adoption of the product.

##### Actors

The user can visualize active questions associated with different geographic points or areas on a map.

**Outcome:**
The user gains an overview of what is being asked at each location at that moment.

---

##### UC-02 – Post a question in a geographic area

**Actor:** User

The user selects an area on the map and posts a question associated with that geographic zone.

**Precondition:**
The user is authenticated in the application.

**Outcome:**
The question remains visible for a limited period of time and a temporary discussion thread is created.

---

##### UC-03 – Receive questions based on proximity

**Actor:** User

The user receives notifications of questions when they are physically located within the geographic area defined by a question.

**Precondition:**
The user is located within the geographic area of the question.

**Outcome:**
The user can access the question thread and participate by answering.


---

##### UC-04 – Answer a question

**Actor:** User

The user can answer an active question only if they are physically located within the geographic area associated with the question.

**Precondition:**
The user is within the area defined for the question.

**Outcome:**
The answer is published in the question thread and becomes visible to other users.


---

##### UC-05 – View answers to a question

**Actor:** User

The user accesses a question thread and views the existing answers.

**Outcome:**
The user obtains real-time information about the state of the location.

---

##### UC-06 – Rate answers

**Actor:** User

The user can rate answers provided by other users (for example, useful or not useful).

**Outcome:**
Higher-rated answers gain increased visibility within the thread.

---

##### UC-07 – Automatic expiration of questions

**Actor:** System

The system automatically deactivates questions once their lifetime has elapsed.

**Outcome:**
Only relevant and up-to-date questions and answers are displayed.

---

##### MVP Scope

The following elements are explicitly out of scope for the MVP:

- Payments and monetization.
- Subscriptions and premium plans.
- Business or organizer profiles.
- Advanced event management.
- Advanced reputation systems.

#### 9.1.2 Key assumptions for the MVP

The development and validation of the MVP are based on the following fundamental assumptions:

**User assumptions:**
- Users are willing to share their real-time location in exchange for relevant information.
- There is genuine demand for instant, verified information about places and events.
- Users trust opinions from people who are physically present more than historical reviews.
- The target audience (18–35 years, urban) has smartphones with GPS and mobile data enabled.

**Technical assumptions:**
- Mobile GPS accuracy is sufficient to validate presence within a defined area.
- System response time (notifications, map loading) is acceptable for a smooth experience.
- The infrastructure can handle the expected concurrency during the pilot without significant degradation.

**Market assumptions:**
- The selected pilot areas have sufficient density of venues and nighttime activity.
- Venues and organizers see value in visibility without immediate payment.
- There is willingness to try a new platform if it solves a real problem.

**Associated risks:**
If any of these assumptions prove false, we will need to pivot or adjust the model before scaling.

#### 9.1.3 MVP Limitations

The MVP has deliberate limitations that will be addressed in later phases:

**Functional limitations:**
- No points or badges system: users can only mark answers as useful or not.
- No advanced search: users see questions on the map but cannot search by specific keywords.
- No sharing to Instagram/Facebook or in-app friend invitations.
- Only simple text and images allowed: no video, GIFs or stickers.
- Notifications are basic: everyone receives the same alerts without interest-based personalization.

**Geographic limitations:**
- Only works in 1–2 neighborhoods of a city during the pilot.
- Not intended for low-venue areas (small towns, rural zones).
- The app is Spanish-only during the MVP.

**Technical limitations:**
- Infrastructure supports only a few hundred concurrent users, not thousands.
- Requires constant internet connection: no offline mode.
- Not optimized for battery or data saving.

**Business limitations:**
- Everything is free: no paid features and venues do not pay to appear.
- Venues cannot see analytics about how many users view their answers or questions.
- No API or third-party integrations available.

These limitations are intentional to reduce complexity, accelerate time-to-launch, and validate the core value before investing in additional features.

- **Average Response Time**: How quickly someone at a location answers a question after it's posted. Faster responses mean better user experience and higher platform value.
- **User Retention**: What percentage of users who ask or answer a question come back the next week and the following weeks. This shows if the app provides enough value to keep users engaged.
- **Geographic Spread**: Where our active users are located across the city. This helps us understand which neighborhoods have strong adoption and where to focus growth efforts.
- **User Type Distribution**: How many users are regular users versus those who create simple events. This helps us understand how the two user roles are being used.

### 10.2 Business Metrics

These numbers tell us if the business model is working and generating revenue:

- **Paid Highlighted Questions**: Number of users paying to boost their questions for more visibility or to keep them on top. This shows if users see value in paid features.
- **Revenue from Highlighted Questions**: How much money we make from users paying to boost questions.
- **Active Business Accounts**: How many companies or event organizers are using the platform to create paid highlighted events.
- **Revenue from Business Events**: How much money businesses spend on highlighted events each month.
- **Customer Acquisition Cost**: How much we spend to acquire one new paid user or business account.
- **Customer Lifetime Value**: How much revenue we expect from a typical business account over their entire relationship with the platform.
- **Churn Rate**: What percentage of paid users stop paying each month. Lower is better, as it means retention of revenue.
- **Average Transaction Value**: On average, how much users and businesses spend when they use paid features.

### 10.3 Growth Metrics

These numbers show how fast the platform is growing and scaling:

- **Weekly Question Growth Rate**: How much the number of questions posted grows from week to week.
- **Weekly Response Growth Rate**: How much the number of answers grows week to week. This indicates growing engagement.
- **Viral Coefficient**: How many new users come from recommendations or invitations by existing users. A high number means the app spreads naturally.
- **Geographic Adoption Rate**: What percentage of the target area (neighborhoods in the city) has at least one active user asking or answering questions.
- **Feature Adoption**: How quickly new features like the basic verification system (likes/dislikes on answers) get used by the community.
- **Event Creation Rate**: How many simple events (football games, meetups) are created by users each week, showing if this secondary feature is gaining traction.
- **Readiness for Expansion**: Metrics for each new city showing when we have enough traction and user base to expand geographically.

## Team

### 11.1 Founders

The founding team consists of professionals with experience in software development, design, and business operations. The team recognized a market opportunity in location-verified, real-time information and is committed to building a product that solves a clear problem. Members bring expertise in mobile and backend development, product design, and strategic planning. The team has worked collaboratively on previous projects and shares a strong vision for creating a platform that changes how people discover venues and get real-time feedback.

### 11.2 Key Roles

The team is organized into three functional areas with clear responsibilities:

**Development**: Responsible for architecting and building the platform, including mobile applications, backend infrastructure, GPS verification systems, and real-time data handling. The development team follows software engineering best practices and ensures code quality and system reliability.

**Design & Marketing**: Focuses on user experience design, product branding, and market positioning. This team shapes how users interact with the product and communicates the value proposition to both users and venues.

**Documentation**: Maintains technical documentation, user guides, and operational procedures. This team ensures all project knowledge is properly recorded and accessible to team members and stakeholders.

## Legal and Risk Aspects

### 12.1 Main Risks

**Location Data and Privacy**: The platform relies on GPS location data to verify user presence. Collecting and storing location information raises privacy concerns and requires compliance with data protection regulations. Unauthorized access or misuse of location data could damage user trust and create legal liability.

**User-Generated Content Liability**: As a platform where users post questions and answers, the app may be held responsible for harmful, false, or illegal content posted by users. Content related to nightlife venues could include misleading information about safety, crowd conditions, or other sensitive topics.

**Age Verification in Nightlife**: The target market includes nightlife venues, which typically restrict access to adults. The platform must ensure that minors cannot access or contribute content about venues with age restrictions, creating compliance challenges.

**Competition and Market Adoption**: Established platforms with larger user bases and more resources may compete directly or evolve to offer similar features. Gaining critical mass of users in a specific geographic area is essential but uncertain.

**GPS Spoofing and Fraud**: Users could potentially manipulate their location data to bypass the Proof of Presence verification, allowing them to post answers from locations where they are not actually present, undermining platform credibility.

**Data Protection Compliance**: Operating across different jurisdictions introduces regulatory complexity. GDPR, CCPA, and other data protection laws impose strict requirements on how location and personal data are collected, stored, and used.

### 12.2 Mitigation Strategies

**Privacy by Design**: Location data is collected only when necessary and stored securely with encryption. Data is retained only as long as required and deleted automatically after content expires. Users have clear control over their location sharing and can opt-out of location collection.

**Content Moderation Framework**: The platform implements user reporting mechanisms, reputation systems, and moderation review processes to identify and remove harmful content. Clear community guidelines and terms of service establish expectations for acceptable behavior.

**Age Verification and Access Controls**: The platform implements age verification mechanisms for accessing nightlife-related content. Geographic fencing prevents minors from posting answers in restricted-access venues.

**Robust Location Verification**: The platform uses multiple GPS verification methods and monitors for suspicious location patterns. Users with repeated location anomalies are flagged and investigated.

**Legal Compliance Team**: Dedicated resources review platform operations against applicable laws in target jurisdictions. Privacy policies and terms of service are regularly updated and clearly communicated to users.

**Data Minimization**: The platform collects only essential location and personal data. Data is anonymized and aggregated wherever possible for analytics and reporting.

### 12.3 Legal Compliance and Privacy

**Data Protection Regulations**: The platform adheres to GDPR, CCPA, and other applicable data protection laws. Users are informed about what data is collected, how it is used, and their rights regarding their data. Privacy policies clearly explain data handling practices.

**Terms of Service**: Clear terms establish user responsibilities, prohibited content, and the platform's right to remove content or terminate accounts that violate community standards.

**Venue Agreements**: Partnerships with venues include terms clarifying data sharing, use of user feedback, and venue responsibilities regarding age restrictions.

**Liability Framework**: The platform operates as a neutral intermediary for user-generated content. While the platform moderates content, it cannot be held liable for all user contributions under applicable safe harbor provisions, provided it acts responsibly to address reported violations.

**Transparent Data Practices**: Users can access, download, or delete their personal data. Location data is not shared with third parties without explicit consent, except where required by law.

## Financial Projections

### 13.1 Cost Structure

#### Initial Costs (One-Time)

- **PWA and Backend Development (MVP)**: €8,000–€18,000 (design, frontend, API, initial deployment).
- **UX/UI Design and Interactive Prototypes**: €1,000–€3,000.
- **Legal and Compliance** (policies, privacy, GDPR advisory): €1,000–€3,000.
- **Launch Materials** (QR codes, posters, printed materials): €300–€1,000.
- **Estimated Total Initial Cost**: €10,300–€25,000.

#### Recurring Operational Costs (Monthly)

- **Hosting and Cloud Services** (databases, notifications, CDN): €100–€800.
- **Monitoring, Logging, and Backups**: €50–€200.
- **Marketing and Local Activation** (pilot intensive weeks): €800–€3,000 (can be concentrated in activation months).
- **Moderation and Support** (team members or contractors): €300–€1,500.
- **Ongoing Administrative and Legal Expenses**: €50–€300.
- **Salaries/Compensation** (if outsourcing or hiring part-time staff): variable; conservative example: €2,000–€6,000.
- **Estimated Total Operational Cost** (pilot phase, small team): ~€1,300–€11,800/month (range depending on salary payments).

#### Key Assumptions

- Founding team contributes work without initial salary costs.
- Infrastructure sized for pilot (50–80 active users) — not for tens of thousands of users.

### 13.2 Revenue Projection (12–24 Month Horizon)

#### Phases and Revenue Model (Aligned with the Document Plan)

- **MVP (months 0–3)**: No monetization.
- **Phase 2 (initial monetization launch, months 4–9)**: Paid highlighted questions (B2C microtransactions) and business visibility (B2B).
- **Phase 3 (national consolidation, months 10–24)**: Venue subscriptions, analytics packages, and campaign fees.

#### Pricing Assumptions (Examples)

- **Highlighted Question (B2C user)**: €0.50 per promotion.
- **Event/Visibility for Business (B2B)**: €15–€60 per campaign/event depending on reach.
- **Monthly Subscription for Venue Analytics** (when available): €50–€200/month.
- **ARPU (Average Revenue Per Monthly Active User)** estimated in early phases: €0–€0.30; during consolidation: €0.5–€2 (depending on B2B).

#### Conservative Scenario (6–12 Months)

- **Pilot (3 active weeks)**: 50–80 active users → revenue ≈ €0.
- **After S2 with gradual monetization**: 500 MAU, low micropayment conversion → monthly revenue ≈ €200–€800.
- **6–12 months**: with expansion to 3–5 cities and first businesses: monthly revenue ≈ €1,000–€6,000.

#### Moderate Scenario (12–18 Months)

- **National (8–10 cities)**, MAU ≈ 10,000 → if ARPU ≈ €0.5 → monthly revenue ≈ €5,000.
- **With 20–40 B2B clients** paying for campaigns and 5–10 subscriptions → +€1,500–€6,000/month.

#### Optimistic Scenario (18–24 Months)

- **International/select capitals**, MAU >50,000, combined ARPU €0.6–€1 → monthly revenue ≈ €30,000.
- **Expanded B2B** (analytics, campaigns) provides significant recurring revenue.

### 13.3 Break-even Point

**Practical Definition**: The point where monthly recurring revenue ≥ monthly operational costs + amortization of initial investment.

#### Example Calculation (Simplified, with Rounded Numbers)

- **Target monthly operational costs** (with minimal team and active marketing): €3,000/month.
- **With average ARPU of €0.5 per MAU**, to cover €3,000 requires ≈ 6,000 active MAU.
- **B2B Alternative**: 12 venues paying €250/month ≈ €3,000/month.

#### Interpretation and Estimated Timeline

- With a conservative strategy, **local break-even (per city)** can be achieved within 3–6 months of intensive activation across multiple zones if early B2B conversion is secured.
- At the **national consolidation level**, expect 9–18 months to achieve overall break-even (depending on investment in salaries and marketing).
- **Factors that accelerate break-even**:
  - Early B2B contracts (venues, promoters).
  - Cost reduction through efficient cloud use and free tools for initial marketing.
  - ARPU improvement via service packaging (volume bundles, subscriptions).

#### Practical Recommendations

- **Prioritize pilot B2B sales** (few accounts with reduced rates) to generate early recurring revenue.
- **Keep cost structure low during MVP** (founders + freelancers), concentrating spending on marketing during activation windows.
- **Measure CAC and LTV from the first pilot** to refine pricing and validate estimated time to break-even.
- **Update projections monthly during S2/S3** with real data (MAU, conversion to paid, acquisition cost).
