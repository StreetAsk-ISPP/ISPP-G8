# Business Plan & Monetization Model 
## 1. Executive Summary 
The event industries currently depend on traditional review platforms that don’t reflect real-time experiences. Services like Google Maps and TripAdvisor rely on reviews that can be outdated. This leads to poor decisions for users and a lack of useful insights for venues and organizers. Our project introduces a real-time review system, where users can only share opinions if they are physically present at a venue or event. This ensures genuine information about what’s happening right now. Users can quickly evaluate key aspects like atmosphere, crowd size, music, wait times, and overall experience. Reviews are easy to submit, quick, and expire shortly after posting, emphasizing live, moment-based feedback. For users, the app enables quicker and better leisure choices, reducing wasted time and disappointing experiences. For venues and event organizers, it offers live feedback, greater visibility among potential customers nearby, and valuable insights into customer experiences. The initial market strategy focuses on launching in one city and a specific area (nightlife and events) to quickly gain traction and validate the model before expanding to new cities and other categories such as restaurants and cultural events. With a strong value proposition focused on presence verification, immediacy, and temporary content, we address a clear gap in the leisure and hospitality market. 

## Company Overview 
### 2.1 Vision and Mission 
#### Vision 
To make it easy for people to know what a place or event is really like right now. 
#### Mission 
To provide real-time, location-verified opinions from people inside venues and events. This helps users make better decisions and gives venues immediate feedback. 
### 2.2 Problem Statement 
People depend on review platforms to decide where to go. However, most available reviews are outdated, generic, and not connected to the current reality of a venue or event. A place with good historical ratings might offer a poor experience due to crowd size, atmosphere, music, or service, leading to frustration and bad choices. At the same time, venues and event organizers lack access to real-time feedback. Existing tools only provide delayed or aggregated reviews, making it hard to understand what’s happening on-site and to respond quickly to improve the experience. As a result, users make decisions based on incomplete information, and venues miss opportunities to adjust and enhance the live experience. 
### 2.3 Proposed Solution 
Our platform changes the leisure decision-making process by replacing static, historical archives with a real-time verification system. By using GPS-fencing, we ensure feedback comes only from users physically present at a venue. This "Proof of Presence" model eliminates fake and outdated reviews, providing a clear and authentic view of the current state of any event or establishment. The main experience focuses on temporary, lightweight updates that reflect the immediate vibe of a location. Users can quickly evaluate crowd density, music styles, and wait times through a dynamic feed that expires shortly after being posted. This keeps the information fresh and relevant, allowing people to navigate the city with confidence and avoid disappointing experiences. For venues and organizers, the solution acts as a live operational dashboard and a responsive marketing tool. It allows them to get instant feedback and adjust their operations on the fly, while also driving foot traffic through real-time promotions. By connecting venues and nearby customers, we turn live data into a powerful tool for both customer satisfaction and business improvement. To address specific, on-demand information needs, the platform also includes a Q&A feature. Users can post questions to a location, which are instantly routed to people currently on-site, allowing them to get answers for hyper-specific queries that general ratings might not cover.

## Product 
### 3.1 App Description 
The app is a real-time social intelligence platform that acts as a live pulse of the city. It provides both a map-based and feed-based interface, allowing users to see exactly what is happening inside any venue at that moment. By combining GPS-verified check-ins with temporary multimedia and quick-rating tags, the app removes the guesswork of going out. 
### 3.2 Key Features 
The main features include a Live Heatmap showing real-time activity levels, Presence-Gated Reviews that unlock only when the user is on-site, and Ephemeral Status Updates that disappear after four hours to keep data fresh. Additionally, it has Smart Filters (music type, crowd age, wait times) and a Venue Portal for business owners to send instant "Flash Deals" to nearby users. 

### 3.3 Value Proposition 
Our value comes from absolute relevance. For users, we provide confidence in having a good time with a look-before-you-go feature. For venues, we offer a direct way to turn digital browsers into physical foot traffic through real-time visibility and instant feedback loops that were previously hard to capture. 
### 3.4 Competitive Differentiation 
Unlike Instagram, which is focused on curated aesthetics, or Google Maps, which is historical and static, our platform is practical and immediate. We stand out with our Proof of Presence technology. While other platforms struggle with review manipulation or fake ratings, our data comes exclusively from people currently experiencing the event. 

### 3.5 Live Q&A: 
A feature allowing users to ask questions directly to a venue's location, which are answered in real-time by people physically present there.
 
## Competitive Analysis 
### 4.1 Target Market 
The project mainly targets the urban leisure and hospitality sector, starting with the high-frequency nightlife and live events industry. This market has a strong demand for immediacy and a demographic that relies heavily on social validation for their choices. By launching in major metropolitan areas, we tap into thousands of venues, including nightclubs, bars, festivals, and pop-up events, that strive to stand out in a crowded digital space. This initial focus serves as a strategic entry point to validate our real-time verification technology before branching out into wider categories like restaurants, cultural shows, and hospitality services. 
### 4.2 Direct and Indirect Competitors 
Direct competitors include localized nightlife apps (such as Nightlife +) and discovery platforms like Resident Advisor or Dice, but they lack live social feedback. Indirect competitors encompass social media giants (Instagram, TikTok) and established review sites (Google Maps, TripAdvisor, Yelp). ### 4.3 Competitive Advantages Our main advantage is the Hyper-Short Feedback Loop. By making reviews expire, we own the "now" niche. Additionally, our Verification Layer (GPS-fencing) builds a high-trust community that established platforms cannot replicate without changing their core structure. This creates a significant barrier to entry for competitors who rely on permanent data.

## Business Model & Monetization

### 6.1 Business Model

The application is built around a **real-time, location-based question and answer platform**, where the core value lies in the **credibility and immediacy of the information**. Credibility is ensured by restricting responses to users who are physically present within the geographical area defined by each question.

Initially, the product follows a **B2C-first, free-access model**, focused on maximizing adoption, participation, and the generation of high-quality, location-verified content. Any user can ask questions tied to a specific point or area on the map, and only users currently within that area can respond in real time. Each question creates a temporary discussion thread that expires automatically.

The business model is designed to evolve towards a **freemium and B2B hybrid**, where monetization is layered on top of a validated core product. Businesses and organizers can later use the platform as a contextual communication and visibility channel, but these features are intentionally secondary and not part of the initial MVP.

This staged approach allows the project to first validate the technical and functional value of the geolocated Q&A system before introducing monetization, reducing product and market risk.

---

### 6.2 Revenue Streams

Revenue generation is planned to be incremental and strictly tied to **visibility, reach, or prioritization**, without restricting access to the core functionality.

1. **Paid Highlighted Questions (B2C)**  
   Users may pay to enhance a question by:
   - Reaching a larger number of users within the selected area.
   - Increasing notification priority.
   - Extending the visibility duration of the question.

   This model is based on microtransactions driven by specific, time-sensitive information needs.

2. **Highlighted Events and Posts for Businesses (B2B)**  
   Companies and organizers can pay to:
   - Promote events or activities on the map.
   - Increase visibility for specific locations or time windows.
   - Communicate contextual information to nearby users.

3. **Usage-Based Limitations**  
   Limits may be applied to:
   - Number of active questions.
   - Number of events created.
   - Maximum geographic reach.

   Paid options allow users or businesses to bypass these limits when needed.

4. **Future Revenue Extensions**  
   In later phases, additional revenue streams may include:
   - Premium subscriptions.
   - Access to aggregated, anonymized insights for businesses.
   - Reputation-based advantages tied to user contribution quality.

---

### 6.3 Pricing Strategy

The pricing strategy is guided by three core principles: **low entry barrier**, **flexibility**, and **clear value alignment**.

- **End Users (B2C):**
  - Free access to the core question-and-answer functionality.
  - Optional pay-per-use enhancements for visibility or reach.
  - No mandatory subscriptions during early phases.

- **Businesses and Organizers (B2B):**
  - Pay-per-event or pay-per-highlight model.
  - Future tiered plans based on usage volume and visibility needs.
  - Pricing adapted to the temporary and local nature of events.

This strategy minimizes friction for new users while enabling monetization only when a clear and immediate benefit is perceived.

---

### 6.4 Monetization Phases

Monetization is introduced progressively, in line with product maturity and validated user behavior.

**Phase 1 – MVP (No Monetization)**  
- Core functionality only: geolocated questions and real-time answers.
- Focus on validating usability, engagement, and response quality.
- Collection of key metrics such as response time, answer rate, and geographic density.

**Phase 2 – Initial Monetization**  
- Introduction of paid highlighted questions.
- Paid event visibility for businesses and organizers.
- Soft limits based on account type.

**Phase 3 – Advanced Monetization and Scaling**  
- Optional premium plans for power users.
- Advanced tools and analytics for businesses.
- Geographic expansion and new use cases.

This phased approach ensures monetization does not compromise early adoption and is always grounded in validated user value.

## Roadmap
### 9.1 MVP
#### 9.1.1 MVP Use Cases

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is defined with the goal of validating the core value of the application: allowing users to post questions linked to a specific location and receive real-time answers from people who are physically present in that area.

The MVP deliberately excludes any functionality related to monetization, business profiles, subscriptions, advanced events, or social features, in order to reduce complexity and encourage early adoption of the product.

##### Actors

- **User**: a registered individual who uses the application to consult or provide real-time information.

In the MVP, no distinction is made between different types of users.

---

##### UC-01 – View active questions on the map

**Actor:** User

The user can visualize active questions associated with different geographic points or areas on a map.

**Outcome:**
The user gains an overview of what is being asked at each location at that moment.

---

##### UC-02 – Post a question in a geographic area

**Actor:** User

The user selects an area on the map and posts a question associated with that geographic zone.

**Precondition:**
The user is authenticated in the application.

**Outcome:**
The question remains visible for a limited period of time and a temporary discussion thread is created.

---

##### UC-03 – Receive questions based on proximity

**Actor:** User

The user receives notifications of questions when they are physically located within the geographic area defined by a question.

**Precondition:**
The user is located within the geographic area of the question.

**Outcome:**
The user can access the question thread and participate by answering.


---

##### UC-04 – Answer a question

**Actor:** User

The user can answer an active question only if they are physically located within the geographic area associated with the question.

**Precondition:**
The user is within the area defined for the question.

**Outcome:**
The answer is published in the question thread and becomes visible to other users.


---

##### UC-05 – View answers to a question

**Actor:** User

The user accesses a question thread and views the existing answers.

**Outcome:**
The user obtains real-time information about the state of the location.

---

##### UC-06 – Rate answers

**Actor:** User

The user can rate answers provided by other users (for example, useful or not useful).

**Outcome:**
Higher-rated answers gain increased visibility within the thread.

---

##### UC-07 – Automatic expiration of questions

**Actor:** System

The system automatically deactivates questions once their lifetime has elapsed.

**Outcome:**
Only relevant and up-to-date questions and answers are displayed.

---

##### MVP Scope

The following elements are explicitly out of scope for the MVP:

- Payments and monetization.
- Subscriptions and premium plans.
- Business or organizer profiles.
- Advanced event management.
- Advanced reputation systems.

#### 9.1.2 Key assumptions for the MVP

The development and validation of the MVP are based on the following fundamental assumptions:

**User assumptions:**
- Users are willing to share their real-time location in exchange for relevant information.
- There is genuine demand for instant, verified information about places and events.
- Users trust opinions from people who are physically present more than historical reviews.
- The target audience (18–35 years, urban) has smartphones with GPS and mobile data enabled.

**Technical assumptions:**
- Mobile GPS accuracy is sufficient to validate presence within a defined area.
- System response time (notifications, map loading) is acceptable for a smooth experience.
- The infrastructure can handle the expected concurrency during the pilot without significant degradation.

**Market assumptions:**
- The selected pilot areas have sufficient density of venues and nighttime activity.
- Venues and organizers see value in visibility without immediate payment.
- There is willingness to try a new platform if it solves a real problem.

**Associated risks:**
If any of these assumptions prove false, we will need to pivot or adjust the model before scaling.

#### 9.1.3 MVP Limitations

The MVP has deliberate limitations that will be addressed in later phases:

**Functional limitations:**
- No points or badges system: users can only mark answers as useful or not.
- No advanced search: users see questions on the map but cannot search by specific keywords.
- No sharing to Instagram/Facebook or in-app friend invitations.
- Only simple text and images allowed: no video, GIFs or stickers.
- Notifications are basic: everyone receives the same alerts without interest-based personalization.

**Geographic limitations:**
- Only works in 1–2 neighborhoods of a city during the pilot.
- Not intended for low-venue areas (small towns, rural zones).
- The app is Spanish-only during the MVP.

**Technical limitations:**
- Infrastructure supports only a few hundred concurrent users, not thousands.
- Requires constant internet connection: no offline mode.
- Not optimized for battery or data saving.

**Business limitations:**
- Everything is free: no paid features and venues do not pay to appear.
- Venues cannot see analytics about how many users view their answers or questions.
- No API or third-party integrations available.

These limitations are intentional to reduce complexity, accelerate time-to-launch, and validate the core value before investing in additional features.
