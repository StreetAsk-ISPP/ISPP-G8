# AI Usage Report

Throughout this project, our team used Generative AI (ChatGPT and Gemini) to learn faster, communicate better, and stay organized. We used these tools not to replace our work, but to support us in areas where we needed a boost.

### 1. Bridging the Technical Gap **
Coming from a web development background, stepping into mobile app development presented some new challenges for us. We used AI as a brainstorming partner to:

* **Debate Architecture:** We had detailed conversations with the AI to understand the nuances of separating Backend and Frontend in a mobile context versus what we were used to in web.
* **Plan Deployment:** It helped us clear up confusion about mobile deployment pipelines.
* **Look Ahead:** We also used it to help draft documentation for **future CI (Continuous Integration) workflows**, ensuring we have a solid plan for automation down the road.

### 2. Refining Communication & Structure
We wanted our documentation to be precise, professional, and easy to read. AI acted as our editor and formatter by:

* **Polishing our writing:** It helped us correct grammar and refine the flow of our reports.
* **Finding the right words:** When we struggled to express a specific concept in English, we used AI to translate and find the most accurate terminology.
* **Summarizing with Tables:** To avoid walls of text, we asked the AI to help us **structure complex information into clean, comparative tables**, making our findings much easier to digest.

### 3. Staying Organized
To keep our team aligned without getting bogged down in administrative work, we used AI to **transcribe our meetings and generate summaries**. This allowed us to focus on the discussion in real-time, knowing we would have a reliable record of our decisions afterwards.

### 4. Creative Support
Finally, to give our first presentation a strong visual opening, we used generative AI to design the **cover image**.
