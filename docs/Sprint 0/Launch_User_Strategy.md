# Launch Users Strategy

## 1. Introduction

This document describes the profile of the very first real users of the application, the strategy to encourage them to adopt the platform and generate real-time content at launch, and the mechanisms that will be used to maintain communication with final users.

The application is a real-time social intelligence platform that primarily relies on ephemeral reviews and status updates from physically present users. To complement this, it integrates a powerful Q&A feature. This document outlines the strategy for encouraging users to adopt the platform and utilize both the status-sharing and question-answering functionalities to generate valuable, real-time content.

## 2. Definition of the First Real Users

The application is designed for **any person seeking real-time information about a specific place**. Users can either browse live status updates and reviews or ask specific questions to people on-site. Therefore, the first real users are not limited to a single demographic group.

### 2.1 Early Individual Users

The first individual users will include:

- People making spontaneous decisions about where to go.
- Locals seeking up-to-date information about nearby places.
- Tourists and visitors exploring unfamiliar areas.
- Students, workers, and families in everyday situations.

Typical situations where early users will benefit include:

- Checking whether a beach is windy, crowded, or comfortable before going.
- Asking about waiting times, atmosphere, or access conditions at venues.
- Verifying weather-related or environmental conditions at a specific location.
- Confirming whether a place is worth visiting at that exact moment.

**Example use case:**  
A user wants to go to a beach but is unsure whether it is windy or crowded. By navigating to the beach’s location on the map and posting a question, users who are currently there can provide immediate, real-world answers.

## 3. Strategy to Encourage Adoption and Content Generation

Since the core value of the application relies on real-time information, early user adoption and active participation are essential.

### 3.1 User Adoption Strategy

To attract the first users, the platform will focus on:

- **Low entry barriers**: Fast and simple onboarding that allows users to interact immediately.
- **Clear usefulness**: Emphasising the advantage of obtaining answers from people who are physically present at a location.
- **Natural usage scenarios**: Encouraging questions related to daily decisions, travel, leisure, and outdoor activities.

---

### 3.2 Incentives for Content Creation

To stimulate user-generated content:

- Free users will have a **limited number of questions per day**, encouraging thoughtful usage.
- Users who actively contribute content (by answering questions or posting quality status updates) will be rewarded with:
  - Increased daily question limits.
  - Higher visibility or reputation within the app.
- A **premium subscription** will allow users to ask more questions per day and gain additional visibility.

This approach balances participation, content quality, and scalability.

## 4. Business Participation and Monetisation

In addition to individual users, the platform will include businesses and event organisers.

### 4.1 Business Users

Business users may include:

- Restaurants, cafés, and bars.
- Event venues and cultural spaces.
- Tourist attractions and local services.

Through a subscription model, businesses will be able to:

- Promote events or special offers on the map.
- Respond to user questions using verified accounts.
- Build trust by providing accurate and official information.

---

## 5. Reliability of Real-Time Information

To maintain trust and usefulness:

- Answers from users physically closest to the location will be prioritised.
- Verified business responses will be clearly identified.
- Time-sensitive questions will expire automatically to avoid outdated information.

---

## 6. Communication with Final Users

The platform will establish direct communication with users through:

- **In-app notifications** for answers, nearby questions, and relevant updates.
- **Email communication** for account management, subscriptions, and important announcements.
- **In-app feedback and support tools** allowing users to contact the development team.

These channels ensure continuous interaction with all final users of the application.

## 7. Conclusion

The application targets any individual seeking real-time, location-specific information. By enabling users to ask questions about any place and receive answers from people who are physically present, the platform creates immediate value. Combined with incentives for participation, business involvement, and clear communication channels, this strategy supports a successful launch and sustainable growth.
