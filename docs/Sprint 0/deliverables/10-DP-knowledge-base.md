## 📅 05/02/2026 – Specific Feedback & Consolidation Actions

### Strengths Identified
- Presentation clear at a high level, with contextualization through everyday problems.
- Positive attempt at slogan and narrative framing.
- Perceived internal structure and design organization within the team.
- Receptive attitude during feedback session.
- Initial problem statement connected with real-life situations.

### Weaknesses Identified
- Time was not fully used.
- Business model unclear (customer vs. user distinction not precise).
- Revenue logic not sufficiently justified.
- Competitor analysis too brief and not deeply structured.
- Order of sections could be improved (competitors before business model).
- Visual design issues (screen usage, font size, contrast, no slide numbering).
- “Antifake” functionality not clearly defined.
- Risk of generating unrealistic expectations due to broad framing of the problem.

### Consolidation Actions Taken

- **Business Model Clarification**
  The distinction between user and paying customer was redefined. The revenue logic and pricing justification were explicitly structured.

- **Reordering of Presentation Flow**
  The competitor analysis was moved before the business model to improve argumentative coherence.

- **Expansion of Competitor Analysis**
  The comparison was expanded to include clearer differentiation and core use-case analysis.

- **Refinement of Value Proposition**
  The problem statement was reformulated to avoid overly broad framing and reduce unrealistic expectations.

- **Visual Redesign**
  Slides were improved:
  - Larger and clearer typography.
  - Better contrast.
  - Improved screen space usage.
  - Slide numbering added.

- **Clarification of the “Antifake” Concept**
  The feature was either clearly defined within the MVP scope or reframed as a future enhancement to avoid ambiguity.

- **Improved Time Management**
  The presentation was rehearsed to ensure full use of the allocated time.

## 📅 12/02/2026 – Specific Feedback & Consolidation Actions

### Strengths Identified
- Stronger and more structured competitor analysis.
- Better comparison based on core use cases.
- Clear improvement compared to previous delivery.
- Increased strategic clarity in differentiation.

### Weaknesses Identified
- Value proposition appears too late in the presentation.
- Weak connection between Key Opener and Elevator Pitch.
- Insufficient focus on the Ideal Customer Profile (ICP).
- Redundancies during oral presentation.
- Strategic positioning not fully precise.
- Need for clearer differentiation from competitors.
- Need to justify business terminology and KPIs with measurable thresholds.
- Communication improvements needed (eye contact, adaptation to non-technical audience).

### Consolidation Actions Taken

- **Stronger Opening Structure**
  The Key Opener was redesigned to communicate the core problem and value proposition within the first slides.

- **Earlier Differentiation**
  Strategic differentiation is now introduced earlier to anchor positioning from the beginning.

- **Clear ICP Definition**
  The Ideal Customer Profile was explicitly defined and integrated into the narrative.

- **Strategic Focus Refinement**
  The initial niche was narrowed to ensure realistic scalability.

- **Comparative Closure**
  A final structured comparison slide was added after competitor and DAFO analysis.

- **Reduction of Redundancy**
  The script was simplified to improve clarity and avoid repetition.

- **Explicit Use of Business Terminology**
  Concepts such as B2B/B2C and KPIs were clarified and supported with measurable thresholds.

- **Communication Rehearsal**
  Rehearsals focused on pacing, eye contact distribution, and adapting explanations for non-technical audiences.
