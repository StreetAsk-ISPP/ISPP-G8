# Pilot Users Definition

## 1. Purpose of Pilot Users

Pilot users are selected individuals who will participate in early
testing phases of the application. Their feedback will help validate
usability, clarity of the concept, and the perceived value of
real-time, location-based questions and answers.

To ensure unbiased feedback, pilot users are preferably external to
the ISPP course and not involved in the project development.
