# Business Plan & Monetization Model

## 1. Executive Summary

The event industries currently depend on traditional review platforms that don’t reflect real-time experiences. Services like Google Maps and TripAdvisor rely on reviews that can be outdated. This leads to poor decisions for users and a lack of useful insights for venues and organizers. Our project introduces a real-time review system, where users can only share opinions if they are physically present at a venue or event. This ensures genuine information about what’s happening right now. Users can quickly evaluate key aspects like atmosphere, crowd size, music, wait times, and overall experience. Reviews are easy to submit, quick, and expire shortly after posting, emphasizing live, moment-based feedback. For users, the app enables quicker and better leisure choices, reducing wasted time and disappointing experiences. For venues and event organizers, it offers live feedback, greater visibility among potential customers nearby, and valuable insights into customer experiences. The initial market strategy focuses on launching in one city and a specific area (nightlife and events) to quickly gain traction and validate the model before expanding to new cities and other categories such as restaurants and cultural events. With a strong value proposition focused on presence verification, immediacy, and temporary content, we address a clear gap in the leisure and hospitality market.

## Company Overview

### 2.1 Vision and Mission

#### Vision

To make it easy for people to know what a place or event is really like right now.

#### Mission

To provide real-time, location-verified opinions from people inside venues and events. This helps users make better decisions and gives venues immediate feedback.

### 2.2 Problem Statement

People depend on review platforms to decide where to go. However, most available reviews are outdated, generic, and not connected to the current reality of a venue or event. A place with good historical ratings might offer a poor experience due to crowd size, atmosphere, music, or service, leading to frustration and bad choices. At the same time, venues and event organizers lack access to real-time feedback. Existing tools only provide delayed or aggregated reviews, making it hard to understand what’s happening on-site and to respond quickly to improve the experience. As a result, users make decisions based on incomplete information, and venues miss opportunities to adjust and enhance the live experience.

### 2.3 Proposed Solution

Our platform changes the leisure decision-making process by replacing static, historical archives with a real-time verification system. By using GPS-fencing, we ensure feedback comes only from users physically present at a venue. This "Proof of Presence" model eliminates fake and outdated reviews, providing a clear and authentic view of the current state of any event or establishment. The main experience focuses on temporary, lightweight updates that reflect the immediate vibe of a location. Users can quickly evaluate crowd density, music styles, and wait times through a dynamic feed that expires shortly after being posted. This keeps the information fresh and relevant, allowing people to navigate the city with confidence and avoid disappointing experiences. For venues and organizers, the solution acts as a live operational dashboard and a responsive marketing tool. It allows them to get instant feedback and adjust their operations on the fly, while also driving foot traffic through real-time promotions. By connecting venues and nearby customers, we turn live data into a powerful tool for both customer satisfaction and business improvement. To address specific, on-demand information needs, the platform also includes a Q&A feature. Users can post questions to a location, which are instantly routed to people currently on-site, allowing them to get answers for hyper-specific queries that general ratings might not cover.

## Product

### 3.1 App Description

The app is a real-time social intelligence platform that acts as a live pulse of the city. It provides both a map-based and feed-based interface, allowing users to see exactly what is happening inside any venue at that moment. By combining GPS-verified check-ins with temporary multimedia and quick-rating tags, the app removes the guesswork of going out.

### 3.2 Key Features

The main features include a Live Heatmap showing real-time activity levels, Presence-Gated Reviews that unlock only when the user is on-site, and Ephemeral Status Updates that disappear after four hours to keep data fresh.

### 3.3 Value Proposition

Our value comes from absolute relevance. For users, we provide confidence in having a good time with a look-before-you-go feature. For venues, we offer a direct way to turn digital browsers into physical foot traffic through real-time visibility and instant feedback loops that were previously hard to capture.

### 3.4 Competitive Differentiation

Unlike Instagram, which is focused on curated aesthetics, or Google Maps, which is historical and static, our platform is practical and immediate. We stand out with our Proof of Presence technology. While other platforms struggle with review manipulation or fake ratings, our data comes exclusively from people currently experiencing the event.

### 3.5 Live Q&A:

A feature allowing users to ask questions directly to a venue's location, which are answered in real-time by people physically present there.

## Competitive Analysis

### 4.1 Competitive Landscape Overview

While several existing applications address isolated aspects of real-time information, geolocation, or community interaction, none combine these elements into a unified, city-wide, real-time geolocated Q&A system. Most competitors focus on only one dimension: events, navigation, messaging, or reviews. This fragmentation creates a clear opportunity for differentiation.

Our application occupies a unique position at the intersection of:
- Real-time information
- Physical presence verification
- Hyperlocal, question-driven interaction
- Ephemeral, context-bound content

Rather than competing head-on with a single category, the product draws inspiration from multiple domains while addressing gaps left by each.

---

---

### 4.3 Core Differentiators

The following elements distinguish the application from all analyzed competitors:

1. **Geolocated Q&A as the Core Interaction Model**  
   Interaction is structured around explicit questions tied to a defined geographic area, rather than posts, chats, or feeds.

2. **Presence-Based Participation**  
   Only users physically inside the defined area can respond, creating a strong trust signal without requiring identity-based verification.

3. **Ephemeral Information by Design**  
   Questions and answers expire automatically, ensuring relevance and avoiding the accumulation of outdated data.

4. **City-Scale, Event-Agnostic Use**  
   The platform works anywhere in the city, regardless of whether an official event exists.

5. **Utility-First Design (Not a Social Network)**  
   No followers, private messaging, or social graphs. The system is optimized for fast decision-making and situational awareness.

---

### 4.4 Competitive Analysis – Value Gap Perspective

Rather than analyzing competitors as direct threats, this section adopts a **value-gap approach**, similar to a market-oriented SWOT analysis. Each competitor category solves a part of the problem, but leaves uncovered needs related to immediacy, credibility, and hyperlocal relevance. The proposed application is positioned precisely in those gaps.

---

---

### Value Creation and Willingness to Pay

The application creates value primarily for **users who need immediate, trustworthy answers about a specific place**, where delayed or generic information is insufficient.

#### Primary Value Segments

- **Urban users** making real-time decisions (queues, access rules, availability, atmosphere).
- **Visitors and tourists** needing up-to-date local insight rather than historical reviews.
- **Event attendees and organizers** requiring situational awareness beyond official communication.
- **Businesses and promoters** seeking contextual visibility exactly when users are nearby and attentive.

#### Why Users Would Pay

Users are willing to pay when:
- The information is **time-critical**.
- The cost of making a wrong decision is high (missed access, wasted time, lost opportunity).
- Existing platforms cannot provide **verified, real-time answers**.

Paid features (e.g., highlighted questions or extended visibility) directly increase the probability of receiving timely and relevant responses, creating a clear and measurable benefit.

#### Why Businesses Would Pay

Businesses and organizers gain:
- **Contextual attention**, not generic advertising.
- Visibility at the exact moment users are seeking information.
- A channel that complements existing platforms rather than replacing them.

---

### 4.5 Competitive Positioning Summary

The proposed application does not aim to replace social networks, messaging apps, or event platforms. Instead, it introduces a **new interaction layer focused on real-time, presence-verified, hyperlocal knowledge exchange**.

By addressing information needs that are currently fragmented across multiple tools—or not addressed at all—the platform occupies a defensible niche where willingness to pay is driven by immediacy, relevance, and trust.


## Business Model & Monetization

The competitive analysis directly informs the proposed business model and monetization strategy. By identifying where existing solutions fail to provide real-time, location-verified information, the project ensures that monetization mechanisms are introduced only where clear user value exists.

This alignment guarantees that revenue is not extracted prematurely, but instead emerges naturally once the platform has proven its usefulness and achieved sufficient user adoption.


### 5.1 Business Model

The application is built around a **real-time, location-based question and answer platform**, where the core value lies in the **credibility and immediacy of the information**. Credibility is ensured by restricting responses to users who are physically present within the geographical area defined by each question.

In its **MVP phase**, the product follows a **fully free-access B2C model**, focused on maximizing adoption, participation, and the creation of high-quality, location-verified content. Any user can ask questions tied to a specific point or area on the map, and only users currently within that area can respond in real time. Each question generates a temporary discussion thread that expires automatically.

Once the core product and usage patterns are validated, the business model is designed to evolve toward a **subscription-based model**, potentially combined with B2B use cases. Premium features may be introduced for advanced users, businesses, or organizers who wish to leverage the platform as a contextual communication, engagement, or visibility channel. These monetization features are intentionally excluded from the initial MVP.

This staged approach prioritizes product validation and user value in the early phase, while allowing for scalable and sustainable monetization through subscriptions at a later stage, thereby reducing both product and market risk.

---

### 5.2 Revenue Streams

Revenue generation is planned to be incremental and strictly tied to **visibility, reach, or prioritization**, without restricting access to the core functionality.

## 5.2 Revenue Streams

Revenue generation is planned to be gradual and primarily based on **premium user accounts**, while keeping the core functionality of the platform accessible to all users.

1. **Premium User Subscriptions (B2C)**  
   Users may subscribe to a premium account that offers enhanced features such as:
   - Increased visibility for their questions and contributions.
   - Priority notifications within selected geographic areas.
   - Extended lifetime of questions and discussion threads.
   - Advanced filters or insights related to local activity.

   The subscription model targets users with frequent, time-sensitive, or professional information needs, while preserving equal access to basic participation for free users.

2. **Premium Accounts for Businesses and Organizers (B2B)**  
   Businesses, event organizers, or institutions may subscribe to premium accounts that allow them to:
   - Publish highlighted events or location-based posts on the map.
   - Communicate contextual information to nearby users.
   - Manage visibility across specific locations or time windows.

3. **Future Revenue Extensions**  
   In later phases, additional revenue streams may include:
   - Tiered subscription plans with advanced analytics or automation tools.
   - Access to aggregated, anonymized insights for professional users.
   - Reputation-based premium features tied to long-term contribution quality.

---

### 5.3 Pricing Strategy

The pricing strategy is guided by three core principles: **low entry barrier**, **flexibility**, and **clear value alignment**.

- **End Users (B2C):**
  - Free access to the core question-and-answer functionality.
  - Optional pay-per-use enhancements for visibility or reach.
  - No mandatory subscriptions during early phases.

- **Businesses and Organizers (B2B):**
  - Pay-per-event or pay-per-highlight model.
  - Future tiered plans based on usage volume and visibility needs.
  - Pricing adapted to the temporary and local nature of events.

This strategy minimizes friction for new users while enabling monetization only when a clear and immediate benefit is perceived.

---

### 5.4 Monetization Phases

Monetization is introduced progressively, in line with product maturity and validated user behavior.

**Phase 1 – MVP (No Monetization)**

- Core functionality only: geolocated questions and real-time answers.
- Focus on validating usability, engagement, and response quality.
- Collection of key metrics such as response time, answer rate, and geographic density.

**Phase 2 – Initial Monetization**

- Introduction of paid highlighted questions.
- Paid event visibility for businesses and organizers.
- Soft limits based on account type.

**Phase 3 – Advanced Monetization and Scaling**

- Optional premium plans for power users.
- Advanced tools and analytics for businesses.
- Geographic expansion and new use cases.

This phased approach ensures monetization does not compromise early adoption and is always grounded in validated user value.

### 5.5 Monetization Summary

The business model is built around a real-time, geolocated question-and-answer platform that prioritizes user value and trust through presence-based participation. The core functionality is offered free of charge to encourage adoption, interaction density, and content generation.

Monetization is introduced progressively through optional, value-driven mechanisms such as enhanced visibility and prioritization, ensuring that revenue capture is directly linked to validated user needs. This phased approach minimizes adoption friction, supports sustainable growth, and aligns monetization with the platform’s core value proposition.


---

## Go-To-Market Strategy

The go-to-market strategy is designed to validate the core value of the product—real-time, location-verified information—before pursuing scale or monetization. Given the platform’s strong dependency on geographic user density, the launch prioritizes controlled environments where immediate utility and rapid feedback loops can be achieved.

Rather than aiming for broad adoption from the outset, the strategy follows a **progressive, locality-first rollout**, minimizing the cold-start problem and ensuring meaningful user interactions from day one.

---

### 6.1 Initial Launch Context

The initial launch targets **geographically dense environments** where users frequently face uncertainty that requires immediate, situational answers. Suitable contexts include:

- University campuses
- Leisure and nightlife districts
- Recurring local events or festivals
- High-traffic urban areas with transient populations

These environments maximize the probability that:
- Users are physically co-located.
- Questions are relevant and time-sensitive.
- Responses can be delivered quickly by nearby users.

By concentrating activity within a limited area, the platform can demonstrate its core value without requiring a large overall user base.

---

### 6.2 Target Early Adopters

The first users are not defined by demographic criteria but by **contextual needs**. Early adopters include:

- Students and young professionals navigating shared spaces.
- Visitors or tourists unfamiliar with local conditions.
- Event attendees seeking real-time situational awareness.
- Users who regularly make decisions based on current conditions (queues, access rules, availability, atmosphere).

These users experience a clear pain point when existing platforms fail to provide up-to-date, location-specific information.

---

### 6.3 Adoption Strategy

Early adoption is driven through **contextual usefulness rather than social engagement**. The platform does not rely on social graphs, invitations, or follower dynamics. Instead, adoption is encouraged through:

- Organic usage within selected launch areas.
- Visibility of active questions on the map.
- Immediate value from answering or receiving answers in real time.

The simplicity of the interaction model (ask a question, receive answers) lowers the cognitive barrier to participation and supports rapid onboarding.

---

### 6.4 Relationship with Monetization

Monetization is intentionally excluded from the initial go-to-market phase. Introducing payments too early would risk reducing participation and content generation, which are critical for validating the system.

The go-to-market strategy therefore prioritizes:
- User engagement
- Response quality
- Geographic density
- Interaction frequency

These elements are prerequisites for any sustainable revenue model and directly inform future monetization decisions.

---

### 6.5 Validation Metrics

Success during the initial rollout phase is evaluated using measurable, product-focused metrics rather than revenue indicators. Key metrics include:

- Average response time per question
- Percentage of questions receiving at least one response
- Question density within defined geographic zones
- User retention within a launch area over time

These metrics allow the team to assess whether the platform effectively delivers real-time, location-verified information.

---

### 6.6 Scaling Strategy

Once the product demonstrates consistent value within initial launch contexts, expansion follows a **zone-by-zone approach**, replicating successful patterns in new areas rather than scaling indiscriminately.

This controlled expansion ensures that growth does not dilute interaction quality and that the platform maintains its core value proposition as it reaches new users.

### 6.7 Maintaining Information Quality

Information quality is maintained through system design rather than heavy moderation. The platform relies on a combination of structural and social mechanisms:

- **Presence-based participation**: Only users physically located within the defined area can respond, reducing spam and irrelevant input.
- **Temporal expiration**: Questions and answers automatically expire, preventing outdated information from accumulating.
- **Community validation**: Basic feedback mechanisms (likes/dislikes or confirmations) allow useful answers to surface naturally.
- **Contextual relevance**: Each interaction is tied to a specific location and time window, limiting ambiguity and off-topic responses.

These mechanisms prioritize lightweight quality control aligned with the MVP scope, while leaving room for more advanced reputation or moderation systems in later phases.

## 6.8 International Expansion

International expansion is not a primary objective during early stages. Due to the hyperlocal nature of the platform, expansion is approached as a **replication of validated local launch patterns**, rather than a centralized global rollout.

Once the product demonstrates consistent value within initial markets, expansion to new cities or countries follows the same principles:
- Focus on geographically dense launch zones.
- Adaptation to local language and cultural norms.
- Incremental rollout to ensure sufficient user density and interaction quality.

This approach minimizes risk and ensures that international growth does not compromise the core value proposition of real-time, location-verified information.

### 6.9 Go-To-Market Summary

The go-to-market strategy reflects a deliberate focus on value creation before value capture. By launching in geographically dense environments where real-time, hyperlocal information is most needed, the platform mitigates the cold-start problem, ensures information quality, and validates its core assumptions through measurable user interactions.

This approach lays a solid and scalable foundation for future monetization and expansion without compromising the core value proposition.

---

---

##### MVP Scope

The following elements are explicitly out of scope for the MVP:

- Payments and monetization.
- Subscriptions and premium plans.
- Business or organizer profiles.
- Advanced event management.
- Advanced reputation systems.

#### 8.1.2 Key assumptions for the MVP

The development and validation of the MVP are based on the following fundamental assumptions:

**User assumptions:**

- Users are willing to share their real-time location in exchange for relevant information.
- There is genuine demand for instant, verified information about places and events.
- Users trust opinions from people who are physically present more than historical reviews.
- The target audience (18–35 years, urban) has smartphones with GPS and mobile data enabled.

**Technical assumptions:**

- Mobile GPS accuracy is sufficient to validate presence within a defined area.
- System response time (notifications, map loading) is acceptable for a smooth experience.
- The infrastructure can handle the expected concurrency during the pilot without significant degradation.

**Market assumptions:**

- The selected pilot areas have sufficient density of venues and nighttime activity.
- Venues and organizers see value in visibility without immediate payment.
- There is willingness to try a new platform if it solves a real problem.

**Associated risks:**
If any of these assumptions prove false, we will need to pivot or adjust the model before scaling.

#### 8.1.3 MVP Limitations

The MVP has deliberate limitations that will be addressed in later phases:

**Functional limitations:**

- No points or badges system: users can only mark answers as useful or not.
- No advanced search: users see questions on the map but cannot search by specific keywords.
- No sharing to Instagram/Facebook or in-app friend invitations.
- Only simple text and images allowed: no video, GIFs or stickers.
- Notifications are basic: everyone receives the same alerts without interest-based personalization.

**Geographic limitations:**

- Only works in 1–2 neighborhoods of a city during the pilot.
- Not intended for low-venue areas (small towns, rural zones).
- The app is Spanish-only during the MVP.

**Technical limitations:**

- Infrastructure supports only a few hundred concurrent users, not thousands.
- Requires constant internet connection: no offline mode.
- Not optimized for battery or data saving.

**Business limitations:**

- Everything is free: no paid features and venues do not pay to appear.
- Venues cannot see analytics about how many users view their answers or questions.
- No API or third-party integrations available.

These limitations are intentional to reduce complexity, accelerate time-to-launch, and validate the core value before investing in additional features.

## Metrics & KPIs

### 9.1 User Metrics

We track how users engage with the core Q&A system to understand if the product is solving real problems:

- **Monthly Active Users (MAU)**: The number of different users who ask or answer at least one question each month. This shows if we're building a sustainable user base.
- **Daily Active Users (DAU)**: How many users open the app and interact with questions each day. This tells us how often people use the platform regularly.
- **Questions Asked**: Total number of location-based questions posted. This is a key metric showing how much people are using the core feature.
- **Response Rate**: The percentage of questions that receive at least one answer within a certain time. A high percentage means people trust the platform and find value in it.
- **Average Response Time**: How quickly someone at a location answers a question after it's posted. Faster responses mean better user experience and higher platform value.
- **User Retention**: What percentage of users who ask or answer a question come back the next week and the following weeks. This shows if the app provides enough value to keep users engaged.
- **Geographic Spread**: Where our active users are located across the city. This helps us understand which neighborhoods have strong adoption and where to focus growth efforts.
- **User Type Distribution**: How many users are regular users versus those who create simple events. This helps us understand how the two user roles are being used.

### 9.2 Business Metrics

These numbers tell us if the business model is working and generating revenue:

- **Paid Highlighted Questions**: Number of users paying to boost their questions for more visibility or to keep them on top. This shows if users see value in paid features.
- **Revenue from Highlighted Questions**: How much money we make from users paying to boost questions.
- **Active Business Accounts**: How many companies or event organizers are using the platform to create paid highlighted events.
- **Revenue from Business Events**: How much money businesses spend on highlighted events each month.
- **Customer Acquisition Cost**: How much we spend to acquire one new paid user or business account.
- **Customer Lifetime Value**: How much revenue we expect from a typical business account over their entire relationship with the platform.
- **Churn Rate**: What percentage of paid users stop paying each month. Lower is better, as it means retention of revenue.
- **Average Transaction Value**: On average, how many users and businesses spend when they use paid features.

### 9.3 Growth Metrics

These numbers show how fast the platform is growing and scaling:

- **Weekly Question Growth Rate**: How much the number of questions posted grows from week to week.
- **Weekly Response Growth Rate**: How much the number of answers grows week to week. This indicates growing engagement.
- **Viral Coefficient**: How many new users come from recommendations or invitations by existing users. A high number means the app spreads naturally.
- **Geographic Adoption Rate**: What percentage of the target area (neighborhoods in the city) has at least one active user asking or answering questions.
- **Feature Adoption**: How quickly new features like the basic verification system (likes/dislikes on answers) get used by the community.
- **Event Creation Rate**: How many simple events (football games, meetups) are created by users each week, showing if this secondary feature is gaining traction.
- **Readiness for Expansion**: Metrics for each new city showing when we have enough traction and user base to expand geographically.

## Team

### 10.1 Founders

The founding team consists of professionals with experience in software development, design, and business operations. The team recognized a market opportunity in location-verified, real-time information and is committed to building a product that solves a clear problem. Members bring expertise in mobile and backend development, product design, and strategic planning. The team has worked collaboratively on previous projects and shares a strong vision for creating a platform that changes how people discover venues and get real-time feedback.

### 10.2 Key Roles

The team is organized into three functional areas with clear responsibilities:

**Development**: Responsible for architecting and building the platform, including mobile applications, backend infrastructure, GPS verification systems, and real-time data handling. The development team follows software engineering best practices and ensures code quality and system reliability.

**Design & Marketing**: Focuses on user experience design, product branding, and market positioning. This team shapes how users interact with the product and communicates the value proposition to both users and venues.

**Documentation**: Maintains technical documentation, user guides, and operational procedures. This team ensures all project knowledge is properly recorded and accessible to team members and stakeholders.

## Legal and Risk Aspects

### 11.1 Main Risks

**Location Data and Privacy**: The platform relies on GPS location data to verify user presence. Collecting and storing location information raises privacy concerns and requires compliance with data protection regulations. Unauthorized access or misuse of location data could damage user trust and create legal liability.

**User-Generated Content Liability**: As a platform where users post questions and answers, the app may be held responsible for harmful, false, or illegal content posted by users. Content related to nightlife venues could include misleading information about safety, crowd conditions, or other sensitive topics.

**Age Verification in Nightlife**: The target market includes nightlife venues, which typically restrict access to adults. The platform must ensure that minors cannot access or contribute content about venues with age restrictions, creating compliance challenges.

**Competition and Market Adoption**: Established platforms with larger user bases and more resources may compete directly or evolve to offer similar features. Gaining critical mass of users in a specific geographic area is essential but uncertain.

**GPS Spoofing and Fraud**: Users could potentially manipulate their location data to bypass the Proof of Presence verification, allowing them to post answers from locations where they are not actually present, undermining platform credibility.

**Data Protection Compliance**: Operating across different jurisdictions introduces regulatory complexity. GDPR, CCPA, and other data protection laws impose strict requirements on how location and personal data are collected, stored, and used.

### 11.2 Mitigation Strategies

**Privacy by Design**: Location data is collected only when necessary and stored securely with encryption. Data is retained only as long as required and deleted automatically after content expires. Users have clear control over their location sharing and can opt out of location collection.

**Content Moderation Framework**: The platform implements user reporting mechanisms, reputation systems, and moderation review processes to identify and remove harmful content. Clear community guidelines and terms of service establish expectations for acceptable behavior.

**Age Verification and Access Controls**: The platform implements age verification mechanisms for accessing nightlife-related content. Geographic fencing prevents minors from posting answers in restricted-access venues.

**Robust Location Verification**: The platform uses multiple GPS verification methods and monitors for suspicious location patterns. Users with repeated location anomalies are flagged and investigated.

**Legal Compliance Team**: Dedicated resources review platform operations against applicable laws in target jurisdictions. Privacy policies and terms of service are regularly updated and clearly communicated to users.

**Data Minimization**: The platform collects only essential location and personal data. Data is anonymized and aggregated wherever possible for analytics and reporting.

### 11.3 Legal Compliance and Privacy

**Data Protection Regulations**: The platform adheres to GDPR, CCPA, and other applicable data protection laws. Users are informed about what data is collected, how it is used, and their rights regarding their data. Privacy policies clearly explain data handling practices.

**Terms of Service**: Clear terms establish user responsibilities, prohibited content, and the platform's right to remove content or terminate accounts that violate community standards.

**Venue Agreements**: Partnerships with venues include terms clarifying data sharing, use of user feedback, and venue responsibilities regarding age restrictions.

**Liability Framework**: The platform operates as a neutral intermediary for user-generated content. While the platform moderates content, it cannot be held liable for all user contributions under applicable safe harbor provisions, provided it acts responsibly to address reported violations.

**Transparent Data Practices**: Users can access, download, or delete their personal data. Location data is not shared with third parties without explicit consent, except where required by law.

### 12.2 Revenue Projection (12–24 Month Horizon)

#### Phases and Revenue Model (Aligned with the Document Plan)

- **MVP (months 0–3)**: No monetization.
- **Phase 2 (initial monetization launch, months 4–9)**: Paid highlighted questions (B2C microtransactions) and business visibility (B2B).
- **Phase 3 (national consolidation, months 10–24)**: Venue subscriptions, analytics packages, and campaign fees.

#### Pricing Assumptions (Examples)

- **Highlighted Question (B2C user)**: €0.50 per promotion.
- **Event/Visibility for Business (B2B)**: €15–€60 per campaign/event depending on reach.
- **Monthly Subscription for Venue Analytics** (when available): €50–€200/month.
- **ARPU (Average Revenue Per Monthly Active User)** estimated in early phases: €0–€0.30; during consolidation: €0.5–€2 (depending on B2B).

#### Conservative Scenario (6–12 Months)

- **Pilot (3 active weeks)**: 50–80 active users → revenue ≈ €0.
- **After S2 with gradual monetization**: 500 MAU, low micropayment conversion → monthly revenue ≈ €200–€800.
- **6–12 months**: with expansion to 3–5 cities and first businesses: monthly revenue ≈ €1,000–€6,000.

#### Moderate Scenario (12–18 Months)

- **National (8–10 cities)**, MAU ≈ 10,000 → if ARPU ≈ €0.5 → monthly revenue ≈ €5,000.
- **With 20–40 B2B clients** paying for campaigns and 5–10 subscriptions → +€1,500–€6,000/month.

#### Optimistic Scenario (18–24 Months)

- **International/select capitals**, MAU >50,000, combined ARPU €0.6–€1 → monthly revenue ≈ €30,000.
- **Expanded B2B** (analytics, campaigns) provides significant recurring revenue.

---

### 12.3 Break-even Point

**Practical Definition**: The point where monthly recurring revenue ≥ monthly operational costs + amortization of initial investment.

#### Example Calculation (Simplified, with Rounded Numbers)

- **Target monthly operational costs** (with minimal team and active marketing): €3,000/month.
- **With average ARPU of €0.5 per MAU**, to cover €3,000 requires ≈ 6,000 active MAU.
- **B2B Alternative**: 12 venues paying €250/month ≈ €3,000/month.

#### Interpretation and Estimated Timeline

- With a conservative strategy, **local break-even (per city)** can be achieved within 3–6 months of intensive activation across multiple zones if early B2B conversion is secured.
- At the **national consolidation level**, expect 9–18 months to achieve overall break-even (depending on investment in salaries and marketing).
- **Factors that accelerate break-even**:
  - Early B2B contracts (venues, promoters).
  - Cost reduction through efficient cloud use and free tools for initial marketing.
  - ARPU improvement via service packaging (volume bundles, subscriptions).

#### Practical Recommendations

- **Prioritize pilot B2B sales** (few accounts with reduced rates) to generate early recurring revenue.
- **Keep cost structure low during MVP** (founders + freelancers), concentrating spending on marketing during activation windows.
- **Measure CAC and LTV from the first pilot** to refine pricing and validate estimated time to break-even.
- **Update projections monthly during S2/S3** with real data (MAU, conversion to paid, acquisition cost).
