# 📑 Monetization Strategy and Pricing Model: StreetAsk

---

# 1. Executive Summary of Monetization

StreetAsk uses a hybrid model (Freemium + B2B Subscription) designed under a Lean structure. It is based on the premise that real-time information has economic value tied to immediacy.

- **Free users:** Act as "data sensors" and financial assets, covering infrastructure costs through mandatory interstitial ads on each post.
- **Premium users:** Generate recurring revenue through a highly optimized micro-payment that removes the psychological barrier of 3 EUR.
- **Business users:** Provide recurring revenue through a flexible monthly subscription aligned with ROI and without permanence.

# 2. Market Benchmarking

| App | Business Model | User Price | Business Price |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Nextdoor | Freemium + B2B | Free | Local ads (variable) |
| Citizen | Subscription | EUR 19.99/month | N/A |
| Waze | Ads (Crowdsourced) | Free | Ads from EUR 2 CPM |
| Meetup | B2B Subscription | Free (Attend) | EUR 16.99/month |
| StreetAsk | Optimized Hybrid | EUR 2.99/month | EUR 19.99/month |

**Positioning rationale:**  
StreetAsk sits at the "high-conversion point." By reducing the Premium price to EUR 2.99, we move away from higher-cost competitors and become an impulse purchase. For businesses, the monthly model ensures predictable revenue while remaining accessible to local venues.
