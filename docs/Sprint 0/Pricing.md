📑 Monetization Strategy and Pricing Model: StreetAsk

## 1. Executive Summary of Monetization
StreetAsk uses a hybrid model (Freemium + B2B) designed under a Lean structure. It is based on the premise that real-time information has economic value tied to immediacy.

- Free users: Act as "data sensors" and financial assets, covering infrastructure costs through mandatory interstitial ads on each post.
- Premium users: Generate recurring revenue through a highly optimized micro-payment that removes the psychological barrier of 3 EUR.
- Business users: Provide immediate capital through a "pay-per-use" model that removes the friction of fixed subscriptions.

## 2. Market Benchmarking

| App | Business Model | User Price | Business Price |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| Nextdoor | Freemium + B2B | Free | Local ads (variable) |
| Citizen | Subscription | EUR 19.99/month (Protect) | N/A |
| Waze | Ads (Crowdsourced) | Free | Ads from EUR 2 CPM |
| Meetup | B2B Subscription | Free (Attend) | EUR 16.99/month (Organize) |
| StreetAsk | Optimized Hybrid | EUR 2.99/month (Premium) | EUR 49 (Activation + Welcome Pack (1 Event)) + EUR 14.99/Boost |

**Positioning rationale:** StreetAsk sits at the "high-conversion point." By reducing the Premium price to EUR 2.99, we move away from higher-cost competitors and become an impulse purchase. For businesses, the EUR 49 one-time model is more attractive than monthly payments because it removes the "commitment fear."

## 3. Business Model Context and Execution

### 3.1 Plan Structure: FREE Plan (Critical Mass)
The main goal of this plan is user acquisition and content volume generation at no direct cost for users, while keeping sustainability through active ads.

- User cost: EUR 0
- Sustainability model: Funded by mandatory interstitial ads at the moment of posting.
- Estimated revenue: EUR 0.01 per question posted.

**Base access (included):**

- Create geolocated questions and participate in threads.
- Answer, vote, and earn coins for verified contributions.
- View the question and event map, search and filter events.
- Mark attendance at events and use the event chat.
- Receive notifications of nearby activity and responses to your questions.
- Profile, coin history, and rewards store.

**FREE operational details:**

- Question duration with a default value (2h) to keep information fresh.
- Interstitial ads when posting questions (does not block use, adds minor friction).

Use cases:

- "I want to know if there is a line at a bar right now." I post the question, see the ad, and get nearby replies.
- "I need a plan for tonight." I explore the map, filter events, and chat with attendees.

### A. eCPM Analysis (Key Metric)
eCPM (effective Cost Per Mille) represents the revenue for every 1,000 ad impressions.

- Market data (Spain/Europe 2024-2026): For interstitial ads (full screen after an action), average eCPM ranges from EUR 8.00 to EUR 12.00.
- StreetAsk estimate: A conservative value of EUR 10.00 to keep projections prudent.

### B. Revenue per Unit (Question) Calculation
Each time a FREE user taps the "Post" button, an ad event is triggered and generates automatic revenue.

eCPM/1,000 = Revenue per impression

EUR 10.00/1,000 = EUR 0.01

Technical justification: This micro-moment of monetization ensures each posting interaction covers part of the operating costs of the free service.

### C. Pilot User Projection (Scalability)
Based on a sample of 100 pilot users:

| Concept | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| Average behavior | 2 questions/day per user |
| Total daily impressions | 200 ads/day |
| Daily revenue | EUR 2.00/day |
| Monthly revenue (30 days) | EUR 60.00/month |

### D. FREE Plan Limitations
To encourage conversion to higher plans and maintain network dynamism, the following restrictions apply:

- Question duration: 2 hours by default (encourages rotation and map freshness).
- Action radius: Standard (500m - 1km).
- Ads: Interstitial on publish (light friction, does not block use).
- Features: No critical features are blocked; Premium advantages are about convenience, visibility, or personalization.

### 3.2 PREMIUM Plan (Power Users)
Designed for recurring users (18-35 years) who want an optimized experience, privacy, and advanced real-time tools.

**Differentiating benefits:**

- Ad-Free: Browsing and posting without ad interruptions.
- Time Control: Question duration configuration up to 24h.

### 1) Visibility and reach
- Highlight your own questions on the map for a short period (without displacing FREE questions).
- Priority notifications to nearby users to accelerate replies.
- Visual "Featured Question" label to improve response rate.
- **Incentive for responders:** Users who answer featured questions earn **2x coins** compared to normal answers.

Gamification mechanics:
- Normal question: 1 coin per response (if verified or well rated).
- Featured question (Premium): 2 coins per response.
- Featured questions have a clear visual label on the map and in notifications.
- This creates a virtuous loop: more users answer featured questions -> premium users receive faster and more responses -> premium becomes more attractive.

Use cases:
- "I am at the door and need to know if there is a line." I highlight the question and get replies in minutes.
- "I am looking for electronic music right now." The featured question improves visibility and incentives.

### 2) Control and personalization
- Question duration configurable up to 24h.
- Saved favorite zones (multi-zone) with personalized alerts.
- Advanced map filters (density, trend, response level, recent activity).

Use cases:
- "I am going out later." I extend my question validity into the evening.
- "I want plans near two neighborhoods." I save both zones and activate alerts separately.
- "I only want places with high response." I filter by response rate to avoid inactive questions.

### 3) Personal information and analytics
- Weekly activity summary (best answers, most active places, response rate).
- Extended question and answer history (personal archive).
- Enhanced reputation indicators (advanced badges and visible levels).

Use cases:
- "I want to improve my answers." I see where my answers are better rated.
- "I need to review my questions from last month." I access the personal archive without losing history.

### 4) Frictionless experience
- No ads when posting questions.
- "Smart silent" mode for non-urgent notifications.
- Early access to new features (beta opt-in).

Use cases:
- "I am working." Silent mode only lets important notifications through.
- "I want to try new filters." I enable the beta without affecting FREE users.

### 5) Integrable benefits
- Monthly featured credits (e.g., 2 featured questions per month).
- Visual profile customization (premium frame, exclusive icons, color theme).
- Sticker or reaction pack for event chat.
- Priority in-app support (faster queue, no blocking of FREE users).
- Temporary reputation boost visible on the profile (does not change quality ranking, only the label).

### 3.3 BUSINESS Plan (Venues and Organizers)
Unlike individual users, the Business segment uses StreetAsk as a tool for Return on Investment (ROI) and physical foot traffic.

**Value proposition:**

Full access to manage events and promotions:
- Create official and sponsored events (bars, clubs, restaurants, promoters).
- "Verified Business" badge on profile and events.
- Statistics dashboard (views, attendees, real-time interactions).
- Permanently highlight events on the map with an exclusive icon.
- Answer questions with an "Official Reply" label (verified and prioritized).
- Create recurring events (daily, weekly, monthly).
- Promotions and direct offers to nearby users via sponsored events.
- Access to "Community Insight" (frequent questions, peak hours, trends).
- Priority support via in-app chat + email.

**Operational details and limitations:**

- Registration and verification with CIF/NIF.
- Verification fee (one-time payment) for panel access and official badge.
- Event boost to highlight during weekends or high-demand slots.
- No mandatory subscription; the business invests only when visibility is needed.
- Access to basic marketing tools (tracking analysis, reports).

Use cases:
- "My club has events every night." I create recurring weekly events and receive interest notifications.
- "I want to know if my happy hour attracts people." I see real-time view and attendance stats.
- "People ask about the dress code." I answer with the official tag and my reply appears prioritized.
- "I have a special offer." I create a sponsored event that stands out during peak time.

### 3.4 Comparative Scenario Analysis (100 Pilot Users)
To determine the optimal price for MVP launch, we analyze three scenarios based on market metrics 2025-2026.

| Metric | Scenario 1: Low-Barrier | Scenario 2: Standard | Scenario 3: Support & Tribe |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Gross Price | EUR 2.99 | EUR 4.99 | EUR 9.99 (One-time) |
| Conversion (CVR) | 4.2% | 1.8% | 10% (Local community) |
| Paying Users | 4 users | 2 users | 10 users |
| Assessment | Most balanced | Inefficient for MVP | Ideal for initial cash |

Technical decision: The EUR 2.99 price is selected. By staying below the consumer "reflection threshold" (EUR 3.00), subscriber volume compensates the lower margin, maximizing ARPU (Average Revenue Per User).

### 3.5 Net Revenue Analysis
After applying current taxation in Spain (2026) and platform fees (Google/Apple), the monthly net performance for 100 pilots is:

1. Ad revenue (96-98 users): EUR 60.00
2. Premium net revenue (Plan EUR 2.99):
- Gross: EUR 11.96
- (-) VAT (21%): EUR 2.07
- (-) Store fee (15% on net): EUR 1.48
- Premium net: EUR 8.41
3. MONTHLY TOTAL (Ads + Sub): EUR 68.41

## 4. Scalability and Growth Projection
To validate the business model for investors or evaluators, we project a scenario of 10,000 active users.

### 4.1 Scaled P&L (EBITDA)
| Concept | Scenario 10,000 Users |
| --- | ---: |
| Monthly Revenue (Ads + Premium) | EUR 6,600 |
| Infrastructure Costs (Firebase + Mapbox) | ~EUR 500 |
| Net Profit (EBITDA) | EUR 6,100 |

### 4.2 Scalability Conclusions
- Cost efficiency: While revenue grows exponentially, infrastructure costs (database reads and map APIs) grow much more slowly, ensuring a healthy operating margin.
- Ad engine: 87% of revenue volume comes from FREE plan ads. This confirms the free user is not a "cost" but the financial engine that sustains the project.
- Team viability: A profit of EUR 6,100/month would allow a gratification of about EUR 305/month per student (for a team of 20), validating the return on time invested.

### 3.6 Pricing Scenarios (Business)
Three models are evaluated to determine which maximizes revenue without slowing adoption in a 100-user pilot environment:

| Model | Mechanics | Est. Revenue (100 pilots) | Assessment |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| Entry Filter | One-time Payment (EUR 99) | EUR 198.00 | Large upfront cash, not recurring. |
| Local SaaS | Subscription (EUR 19.99/month) | EUR 39.98/month | Hard to sell with a small audience. |
| Flexible Hybrid | EUR 49 fee + EUR 14.99/Boost | EUR 98.00 + boosts | Recommended for flexibility and low friction. |

### 3.7 Final Proposal: Hybrid Model
We chose a model that balances entry barrier with recurring profitability:

1. Verification fee (EUR 49.00): One-time payment for panel access and official badge. Anti-spam quality filter. Includes a welcome pack with 1 event (EUR 14.99).
2. Visibility boost (EUR 14.99): Pay to highlight an event or pin during a weekend.

Consulting justification: This model aligns app cost with real business benefit. The client invests in boosts only when a business opportunity is identified (sales, events, off-peak hours).

## 5. Economic and Operational Viability (MVP)
### 5.1 Break-even Point
Thanks to strategic use of cloud infrastructure (Firebase Spark and Mapbox Free Tier), StreetAsk has a highly efficient cost structure:

- Current operating cost: EUR 0.00 (within free tiers).
- Self-financing capacity: The EUR 60.00/month generated by FREE plan ads is enough to cover the jump to professional servers once the pilot phase is surpassed.

### 5.2 Cash Summary - First Month (100 Pilot Users)
Applying the hybrid and conservative model:

- Advertising (FREE Plan): EUR 60.00
- Premium subscriptions (Net): EUR 8.41
- Business activations (2 venues): EUR 98.00
- TOTAL REVENUE: EUR 166.41

## 6. Strategic Decision Rationale (Decision Matrix)
This section explains the decisions made for each plan, analyzing the "why" behind each pivot from the initial idea.

### 6.1 On the FREE Plan: The Value of "Fresh Content"
- Decision: Require interstitial ads when posting.
- Why: Initially static banners were considered, but eCPM was too low. By moving the ad to the "post click" moment, each interaction generates EUR 0.01.
- Result: The free user stops being a cost and becomes a financial asset that pays for the servers.

### 6.2 On the PREMIUM Plan: The "Micro-Payment" Threshold
- Decision: Lower the price from the initial EUR 4.99 to EUR 2.99.
- Why: Market analysis (2025-2026) shows that in utility apps, the psychological barrier of EUR 3.00 is critical.
    - At EUR 4.99, conversion dropped to 1.8%.
    - At EUR 2.99, conversion rises to 4.2%.
- Result: Although margin per unit is lower, volume compensates the drop, achieving 20% more net revenue than with the higher price.

### 6.3 On the BUSINESS Plan: From "Commitment Fear" to the Hybrid Model
- Decision: Remove mandatory subscription and set an Entry Fee (EUR 49) + Pay-per-use.
- Why: Local businesses (bars, shops) resist fixed monthly costs if they do not see immediate ROI.
    - The one-time fee gives them peace of mind (lifetime presence).
    - The event boost (EUR 14.99) lets them invest only when they have a real offer to promote.
- Result: We reduce sales friction and align our success with the business.

### 6.4 On Cost Structure: The "Lean" Model
- Decision: Keep infrastructure on free tiers (Firebase Spark) for as long as possible.
- Why: In a 20-student team, financial risk must be zero. Spending only scales when ad revenue validates it.
- Result: A project with zero financial risk and profit from day one.

### 6.5 Synthesis Matrix: Business Model Evolution
| Segment | Initial Idea (Hypothesis) | Strategic Change (Pivot) | Reason for Change | Project Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FREE Plan | Passive static banners. | Interstitial ad on posting. | Low eCPM of traditional banners. | User monetized: EUR 0.01 per interaction. |
| PREMIUM Plan | EUR 4.99 subscription. | Reduced to EUR 2.99. | Micro-payment psychological barrier. | Conversion increase from 1.8% to 4.2%. |
| BUSINESS Plan | Fixed monthly subscription. | Entry fee + Welcome pack + Pay-per-use. | Businesses reject fixed costs without ROI. | Friction removed; revenue from occasional boosts. |
| Structure | Fast server scaling. | "Lean" model (Firebase Spark). | Minimize risk in academic setting. | Zero financial risk and positive cash flow. |
