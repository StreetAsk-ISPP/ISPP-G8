## Meeting objective
Review and restructure the presentation for the next delivery, clarify product differentiation against competitors (especially event-based apps), refine MVP scope, and improve premium model features based on previous professor feedback.

# Decisions made

## Presentation Structure
- Each deliverable must have its own presentation file (not reuse the previous one).
- Add a short introduction explaining the product idea before diving into details.
- Include a strong elevator pitch at the beginning.
- Make slides self-contained and clear without requiring verbal explanation.
- Unify strengths/weaknesses into combined comparative slides for clarity.
- Avoid overloading slides with too much raw data (e.g., full pilot user lists).

## Pilot Users
- Continue increasing the number of pilot users.
- Show a summarized and anonymized version of pilot users (partial name, age, masked email).
- Do not include full raw data in slides.
- Surveys and pilot users are separate: survey = validation; pilot users = future testers.

## Competitor Differentiation
- Main differentiation: the app does not depend on pre-created events.
- Competitor apps only allow interaction inside predefined private events.
- Our app allows autonomous interaction: users can ask questions anytime, anywhere, without needing an organizer.
- Replace vague wording like “uso cotidiano” or “para todo” with clearer concepts such as:
  - Autonomous interaction
  - Independence from events
  - User-driven interaction
- Improve the comparison table so differentiation is immediately clear.
- Add a new row in the comparison: “Questions outside events”.

## MVP & Core Functionalities
- Clearly separate:
  - Core Functionalities (what defines the product)
  - MVP (minimum viable implementation including login, payments, admin, etc.)
- Remove login mockups from the main presentation.
- Show product mockups visually summarized (2–3 per slide).
- Interactive mockup optional at the end.
- If possible, simplify interactive prototype to skip login/register flow.

## Business Model & Premium Features
- Current premium differentiation (no ads + custom question duration) is weak.
- Add stronger premium features:
  - Highlighted questions (appear first in list).
  - Limit highlighted questions per day.
  - Adjustable question radius.
  - Extended question duration.
- Ads appear after submitting a question (not banner-style).
- Consider enhanced reward logic for highlighted questions.

## Radius Functionality
- Default radius between 500m–1km.
- Premium users may adjust radius.
- Consider GPS accuracy limitations in crowded areas.

## Organization & Style
- No need to include team photos if not homogeneous.
- Prioritize product clarity and differentiation over aesthetic extras.
- Keep mockups clean and focused on core use cases.

## Open Points
- Final wording for product differentiation in competitor table.
- Rules and limits for highlighted questions.
- UX and technical implications of adjustable radius.
- Final structure of business model slides.

## Next meeting
- To be confirmed via WhatsApp group.
