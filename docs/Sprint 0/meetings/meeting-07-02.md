## Meeting objective
This meeting was scheduled to organize tasks and teams for the following week and to clarify all documentation created so far.
It also covered product functionality details that were not previously clear.

# Decisions made

Regarding functionality, we decided the following:
- Only company accounts will be able to create events.
- Company accounts will be paid-only through a monthly fee.
- User accounts will have two plans: free (with ads) and premium (without ads). Premium accounts can set the question duration; free accounts will have a fixed duration of 2 hours.
- The coin system generated by positive answers will not be redeemed for physical money. Instead, in-app rewards will be offered, such as a month of premium subscription, tickets redeemable for rewards at a company event, etc.
- Inside an event, the model will be Reddit-like: users ask questions and other users respond within each question.
- A user's questions will appear on the map less highlighted than company events.

For any questions, please communicate through the WhatsApp community.

## Next meeting
- Tentative date: 1/02/2026 10:00
