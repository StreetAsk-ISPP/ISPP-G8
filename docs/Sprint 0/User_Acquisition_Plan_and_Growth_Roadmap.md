# User Acquisition Plan & Growth Roadmap

## Strategic Philosophy: The "Liquidity" Engine

Unlike traditional social platforms, our growth is not measured by raw volume, but by geolocated information density. The success of the B2C-Free model lies in reaching the "Liquidity Threshold": the point at which any question asked in a critical zone (e.g., University Campus or Historic Center) receives a verified answer in less than 5 minutes. Our strategy prioritizes Density over Coverage, saturating specific geographic nodes before scaling.

## Execution Phases: The Seville "Playbook"

### Phase 1: Ignition and Dominance in the US Ecosystem (0-6 Months)

The goal is to transform the University of Seville (US) into our "Living Lab" through organic infiltration into the student's daily life.

- **Micro-Community Infiltration:** Strategic agreements with student unions (Delegaciones) and administrators of major departmental WhatsApp/Telegram groups. The app will be positioned as the official tool for expectation management (library seat availability, copy shop queues, and cafeteria menus).

- **ESN Ambassador Program:** Partnership with the Erasmus Student Network to capture the user with the highest information need: the international student who is unfamiliar with the city's rhythms and flows.

- **"Seeder" Strategy (Active Dynamization):** Deployment of a selected team of dynamizers who will generate real-time question flows in high-traffic areas to incentivize participation from passive users and guarantee the "Aha! Moment" (the first successful response).

### Phase 2: Guerrilla Marketing and Transport Hubs

Capturing the user at "friction points" or waiting periods, where the need for information is at its peak.

- **Public Transport Infrastructure:** Implementation of a tactical QR code network at bus stops (TUSSAM), Metro stations, and within VTC/Taxi fleets. The messaging focuses on the competitive advantage: "Where are you headed? Ask now and arrive prepared."

- **Urban Guerrilla Signage:** Use of biodegradable chalk stencils on paths leading to campuses and nightlife districts (Alameda, Alfalfa, Viapol), creating a visual trail toward the application without permanent impact on urban furniture.

## Event-Driven Dynamization and Social Media

The application will be positioned as the city's "live information layer," transforming social media channels into direct traffic funnels.

- **Mass Event Protocol:** During critical milestones (Seville April Fair, Holy Week, concerts at La Cartuja Stadium), specific "Dynamic Reality" threads will be enabled. The app's social media will promote these events, encouraging users to ask specific questions about street closures, booth queues, or real-time access availability.

- **Social Proof & Virality:** "Snapshot" functionality for Instagram Stories, allowing users to share visual status updates of the city's pulse (e.g., a terrace's live vibe) with deep links that incentivize immediate downloads to view the full response.

## Retention and Organic Gamification

To ensure sustainability without recurring to monetary incentives, a Status-Based Economy is implemented:

- **Karma and Reputation System:** Users accumulate points based on the veracity and speed of their responses.

- **"Local Hero" Status:** Public recognition and in-app privileges (such as the ability to highlight their own questions for free) for the most active users in each zone.

- **Inter-Faculty Rankings:** Gamifying collaboration by incentivizing pride in one's faculty or neighborhood to lead the city's response rates.

## North Star Metrics (Management Control)

The success of this growth plan will be audited through the following KPIs:

- **TFA (Time to First Answer):** Average time from question submission to the first valid response (Target: <10 min).

- **Liquidity Ratio:** Percentage of questions receiving at least one useful community interaction.

- **Viral K-Factor:** Rate of new registrations derived from links shared on external channels (WhatsApp/Social Media).

- **Informational Churn:** The lifespan of information before being flagged as obsolete by the system (Target: 4 hours).
